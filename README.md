# Learn CHILENO with Aitumadre


# Aitumadre

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This is an Ai provider to learn the chilean complex street language, words and sounds. 


## Background

My idea solves tourists and students difficulties when they learn chilean spanish. The unortohdox words. The Chileans language phenomen is an languange understood by chileans only. My personal motivation is that i am born in Chile and i traveled there a lot. Many spanish talking people in latinamerica don't understand the chilean vocabulary and think the accent is funny. This topic is important to bring the latinamerican people closer to eachother and for the foreign students to learn chileno. Vamos!
Note: The chilean words in society has often to do with cursing or refering to genitals. 

With this chatbot you will be able to:
* Learn Chileans abbrivations like "sipo" and "no estoy ni ahi"
* Learn social codes, when and where words like "weon or culiao" and similar words and the meaning of them are used depending the situation. 
* Learn about the Never in time phenomen
* Learn about the chilean exil romanticism
* The no line system and what word you can use there.
* Getting to know inspiring everyday chilean people getting famous from their word and behaviour. Like el Zafrada or la mojojojo. 


## How is this used?
Through an app and website. This is used in the streets and normal daily life in Chile, is very helpful for non chileans and students being in chile. Studying, working or touristing. If you are haning out with some "flaites" you have a great vocabulary to find right here. 

For instance, when a person non chilean travels to chile. Sooner then later they will be invited for a "asado" or something similar. A barbecue. At the spot during the evening, many people will come and go. The person who invited him/her will be there but no in time, their family, friends, and neighbours, even the uninvited will appear. All over the time the young person or spanish learner will hear very difficult, mostly bad but funny words that they wont understand. Its important for them to learn this if they wanna have succesfull time in Chile, regardless where they are located in the country. For instance when you come to a spot they anyone could greet you with "wena weon bienvenido, pasa, no te hagay el sueco" instead of a more normal welcome like" Hola, bienvenido" tho it also happen if the situation is more formal. But very fast most situations in chile become unformal.



This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

My procject dont solve normal spanish teaching or learning. Its mostly or only teaching chileno. These are also the limitations. The ethicals considerations are that many of the chileno words can be experienced as bad words.

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
